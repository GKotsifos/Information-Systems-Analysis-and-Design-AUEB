# Information-Systems-Analysis-and-Design-AUEB
These are all the excercises I did alongside my friend and colleague Panagiotis for the Information Systems Analysis and Design Course. Although I found the excercises somewhat enjoyable we did not have of the best time completing them mainly becasue the work load and the limited time we had. Nevertheless we had the best total grade for all the assignments in our class.
